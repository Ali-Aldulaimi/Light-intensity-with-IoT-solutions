Light Dependent resistor also known as the photoresistor is a two terminal passive electronic component that is made up of a semiconductor element or compound.
The LDRs are used in a bridge sensor circuit on order to convert the light into the voltage and thus different actions can be performed for example by feeding the voltage signal into the microcontroller the circuit can be used to determine the darkness in the room and turn on or off the light.
This report will focus on signal processing of light intensity using Nucleo STM32 board and modbus protocol for transmission.
The Nucleo STM32 is a development board designed by STMicroelectronics for their STM32 microcontroller series. It provides an affordable and flexible way for developers to prototype and develop their applications using the STM32 microcontroller family.
The Nucleo board features an STM32 microcontroller, which is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M core with a wide range of features and peripherals. The board also includes an integrated debugger, ST-LINK/V2-1, which allows for easy programming and debugging of the microcontroller. Additionally, the board provides various interfaces such as USB, Ethernet, CAN, SPI, I2C, and more, making it easy to interface with other devices and sensors.
Modbus RTU is a communication protocol commonly used in industrial automation systems to establish communication between different devices, such as sensors, actuators, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It is a serial communication protocol that uses a Master/Slave architecture, where the master initiates and controls the communication, and the slaves respond to the master's requests.
Modbus RTU uses a binary format to transmit data over a serial communication interface, typically using RS-485 or RS-232. It supports a variety of data types, including bits, integers, floating-point numbers, and it allows for the transfer of both process data and configuration parameters between devices.
Additionally, IoT cloud will be used to collect the data from the master.
An IoT cloud is a cloud computing platform that is specifically designed to support the storage, processing, and analysis of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. An IoT cloud typically provides services such as data storage, data management, data analytics, machine learning, and visualization tools to enable the collection and analysis of data from a large number of connected devices.
This report will focus as well on front-end development by visualizing the data from cloud into front-end devices such as Mobile-App or Websites.
